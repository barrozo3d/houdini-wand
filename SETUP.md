# houdini-wand — Setup Guide

This file serves two purposes:
- **For you (human):** step-by-step instructions to get the skill running on a new machine
- **For Claude:** checklist to follow when the user says "set up this skill", "check if installed", or "new machine setup"

---

## For Claude: Setup Sync Rule

**Every structural change to the skill must update these three files in the same commit.**

A structural change is anything that would affect how someone installs or runs this skill on a fresh machine:
- New pip dependency added to `ingest.py` or any script → update `requirements.txt` + `setup.ps1` (pip install step) + `SETUP.md` (Step 3 or Troubleshooting)
- New system dependency (new tool required) → update `setup.ps1` + `SETUP.md`
- New environment variable required → update `setup.ps1` (Step 5) + `SETUP.md` (Step 4 or Troubleshooting)
- Claude API model changed → update `SETUP.md` (reference table if present)
- New CLI flag added to `ingest.py` → update `SETUP.md` (Ingest Pipeline Reference section)
- Directory or file renamed/added → update `SETUP.md` (Skill Structure section)
- Git repo URL changed → update `SETUP.md` (Step 2) + `setup.ps1` (clone URL comment)

**Commit + push format for structural changes:**
```
git add ingest.py requirements.txt setup.ps1 SETUP.md
git commit -m "feat/fix: <what changed> + sync setup pack"
git push
```

Never leave setup files out of sync with the actual skill state. The push is mandatory — the GitHub copy is what other machines clone, so a local-only commit is not enough.

## For Claude: New Machine Setup Protocol

When the user says any of: "set this up", "new machine", "is this installed", "check dependencies", "help me configure this skill" — follow this checklist in order. Run each check as a shell command, report results, and fix what's missing.

```
CHECKLIST:
1. python --version                          → need 3.10+
2. ffmpeg -version                           → need any version on PATH
3. python -c "import yt_dlp"                 → need installed
4. python -c "import whisper"                → need installed
5. python -c "import anthropic"              → need installed
6. python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"  → True = GPU ready
7. echo $env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY               → need sk-ant-... value
8. Test-Path ~\.claude\skills\houdini-wand\SKILL.md   → need True
```

For anything missing:
- **ffmpeg missing** → `winget install ffmpeg`
- **pip packages missing** → `pip install yt-dlp openai-whisper anthropic`
- **torch CPU-only** → `pip install torch --force-reinstall --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128`
- **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY missing** → prompt user to get key from console.anthropic.com, then: `[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY","sk-ant-...","User")`
- **Skill not found** → `git clone https://github.com/barrozo3d/houdini-wand.git ~\.claude\skills\houdini-wand`

After fixing, re-run the checklist and confirm all green before proceeding.

## System Requirements

| Requirement | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| OS | Windows 10 / macOS 12 / Ubuntu 20.04 | Windows 11 |
| Python | 3.10 | 3.11–3.12 |
| RAM | 8 GB | 16 GB+ |
| GPU | — (CPU works) | NVIDIA RTX (any) for fast Whisper |
| Disk | 5 GB free | 10 GB (Whisper models cache here) |
| Internet | Required for ingest | — |
| Houdini | Not required for consulting | H20.5+ for running generated code |

## Step 1 — Install Claude Code

If Claude Code isn't installed yet:
- Download from: https://claude.ai/download
- Or install the VS Code extension: search "Claude" in Extensions

---

## Step 2 — Clone the Skill

Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/barrozo3d/houdini-wand.git "$HOME\.claude\skills\houdini-wand"
```

> If you don't have git: `winget install git`

---

## Step 3 — Run the Setup Script

```powershell
cd "$HOME\.claude\skills\houdini-wand"
.\setup.ps1
```

The script will:
- Check Python version
- Install `ffmpeg` via winget
- Install `yt-dlp`, `openai-whisper`, `anthropic` via pip
- Install PyTorch with CUDA support (if NVIDIA GPU detected)
- Prompt for your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and save it to your user environment

> **Note:** The CUDA torch download is ~2.8 GB. It may take 10–30 minutes depending on your connection.

---

## Step 4 — Get Your Anthropic API Key

The `ingest.py` script calls the Claude API directly (for vision analysis and extraction). You need a key:

1. Go to https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
2. Create a new key
3. The setup script will ask for it — paste it when prompted

If you need to set it manually:
```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY", "sk-ant-YOUR-KEY", "User")
```

Then open a new terminal for it to take effect.

---

## Step 5 — Verify

```powershell
ffmpeg -version
python -c "import whisper, anthropic, yt_dlp; print('all OK')"
python -c "import torch; print('CUDA:', torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

Expected output:
```
ffmpeg version 8.x ...
all OK
CUDA: True    ← only if NVIDIA GPU present
```

---

## Step 6 — Test Ingest

Run a quick test without downloading the full video:
```powershell
cd "$HOME\.claude\skills\houdini-wand"
python ingest.py "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" --skip-video
```

`--skip-video` skips frame extraction so the test runs in ~2 minutes instead of 10+.

---

## YouTube Bot Detection (cookies.txt)

Chrome 127+ broke yt-dlp's automatic cookie extraction (`--cookies-from-browser` fails with DPAPI error). If you see `Sign in to confirm you're not a bot` errors, fix it once:

1. Install the **"Get cookies.txt LOCALLY"** extension in Chrome/Edge/Firefox
2. Go to **youtube.com** while logged in to your Google account
3. Click the extension icon → **Export** → save as **`cookies.txt`**
4. Place `cookies.txt` in `~/.claude/skills/houdini-wand/` (same folder as `ingest.py`)
5. `ingest.py` detects it automatically — no other changes needed

> `cookies.txt` is in `.gitignore` and will never be committed to GitHub.

---

## Troubleshooting

**`ffmpeg: command not found` after install**
Open a new PowerShell window — PATH updates don't apply to the current session.

**`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'whisper'`**
```powershell
pip install openai-whisper
```

**`CUDA: False` when you have an NVIDIA GPU**
```powershell
pip install torch --force-reinstall --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
```

**`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set` errors during ingest**
```powershell
$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-YOUR-KEY"   # current session only
# OR to persist across sessions:
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY", "sk-ant-YOUR-KEY", "User")
```

**Git push fails (authentication)**
```powershell
git config --global credential.helper manager
```
Then re-run the push — Windows Credential Manager will prompt for GitHub login.

**Whisper model download on first run**
The first time Whisper runs it downloads the model (~150 MB for `base`). This is normal — subsequent runs use the cached model.

**Houdini not installed — skill still works**
The houdini-wand skill operates in consultant mode only (no direct Houdini connection). You don't need Houdini installed to ask questions, get VEX code, or ingest tutorials. You only need Houdini to actually run the generated code.

## Ingest Pipeline Reference

```
python ingest.py <url>                         full pipeline
python ingest.py <url> --skip-video            no frames (faster, no ffmpeg needed)
python ingest.py <url> --whisper-model small   better accuracy, slower
python ingest.py <url> --whisper-model medium  best accuracy, much slower
```

Pipeline stages:
1. yt-dlp metadata + chapter list
2. Whisper transcription (or yt-dlp captions fallback)
3. Transcript segmented by chapter
4. Low-quality video download → ffmpeg frame extraction at chapter timestamps
5. Claude vision analysis per frame (reads Houdini network, VEX, parameter editor)
6. Claude multi-pass extraction (core technique, steps, nodes/VEX, tags)
7. Auto cross-linking with existing tutorials (2+ shared tags)
8. Write `.md` + update `INDEX.md` + git push
