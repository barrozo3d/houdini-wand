# houdini-wand — Setup Guide

This file serves two purposes:
- **For you (human):** step-by-step instructions to get the skill running on a new machine
- **For Claude:** checklist to follow when the user says "set up this skill", "check if installed", or "new machine setup"

---

## For Claude: Setup Sync Rule

**Every structural change to the skill must update these three files in the same commit.**

A structural change is anything that would affect how someone installs or runs this skill on a fresh machine:
- New pip dependency added to `ingest.py` or any script → update `requirements.txt` + `setup.ps1` (pip install step) + `SETUP.md` (Step 3 or Troubleshooting)
- New system dependency (new tool required) → update `setup.ps1` + `SETUP.md`
- New environment variable required → update `setup.ps1` + `SETUP.md` (add a step + Troubleshooting entry)
- New CLI flag added to `ingest.py` or `select_frames.py` → update `SETUP.md` (Ingest Pipeline Reference section)
- Directory or file renamed/added → update `SETUP.md` (Skill Structure section)
- Git repo URL changed → update `SETUP.md` (Step 2) + `setup.ps1` (clone URL comment)

**Commit + push format for structural changes:**
```
git add ingest.py requirements.txt setup.ps1 SETUP.md
git commit -m "feat/fix: <what changed> + sync setup pack"
git push
```

Never leave setup files out of sync with the actual skill state. The push is mandatory — the GitHub copy is what other machines clone, so a local-only commit is not enough.

## For Claude: New Machine Setup Protocol

When the user says any of: "set this up", "new machine", "is this installed", "check dependencies", "help me configure this skill" — follow this checklist in order. Run each check as a shell command, report results, and fix what's missing.

```
CHECKLIST:
1. python --version                          → need 3.10+
2. ffmpeg -version                           → need any version on PATH
3. python -c "import yt_dlp"                 → need installed
4. python -c "import whisper"                → need installed
5. python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"  → True = GPU ready
6. Test-Path ~\.claude\skills\houdini-wand\SKILL.md   → need True
```

For anything missing:
- **ffmpeg missing** → `winget install ffmpeg`
- **pip packages missing** → `pip install yt-dlp openai-whisper`
- **torch CPU-only** → `pip install torch --force-reinstall --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128`
- **Skill not found** → `git clone https://github.com/barrozo3d/houdini-wand.git ~\.claude\skills\houdini-wand`

After fixing, re-run the checklist and confirm all green before proceeding.

## System Requirements

| Requirement | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| OS | Windows 10 / macOS 12 / Ubuntu 20.04 | Windows 11 |
| Python | 3.10 | 3.11–3.12 |
| RAM | 8 GB | 16 GB+ |
| GPU | — (CPU works) | NVIDIA RTX (any) for fast Whisper |
| Disk | 5 GB free | 10 GB (Whisper models cache here) |
| Internet | Required for ingest | — |
| Houdini | Not required for consulting | H20.5+ for running generated code |

---

## Step 1 — Install Claude Code

If Claude Code isn't installed yet:
- Download from: https://claude.ai/download
- Or install the VS Code extension: search "Claude" in Extensions

---

## Step 2 — Clone the Skill

Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/barrozo3d/houdini-wand.git "$HOME\.claude\skills\houdini-wand"
```

> If you don't have git: `winget install git`

---

## Step 3 — Run the Setup Script

```powershell
cd "$HOME\.claude\skills\houdini-wand"
.\setup.ps1
```

The script will:
- Check Python version
- Install `ffmpeg` via winget
- Install `yt-dlp`, `openai-whisper` via pip
- Install PyTorch with CUDA support (if NVIDIA GPU detected)

> **Note:** The CUDA torch download is ~2.8 GB. It may take 10–30 minutes depending on your connection.

---

## Step 4 — Verify

```powershell
ffmpeg -version
python -c "import whisper, yt_dlp; print('all OK')"
python -c "import torch; print('CUDA:', torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

Expected output:
```
ffmpeg version 8.x ...
all OK
CUDA: True    ← only if NVIDIA GPU present
```

---

## Step 5 — Test Ingest

Run a quick test without downloading the full video:
```powershell
cd "$HOME\.claude\skills\houdini-wand"
python ingest.py "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" --skip-video
```

Step 1 alone (`ingest.py`, with or without `--skip-video`) never downloads video anymore — it only collects transcript + metadata, so this test runs in ~2 minutes either way. `--skip-video` instead permanently marks the tutorial `frame_status: skipped` (use it for text-only ingests where frame capture will never apply); without it, frames stay `pending-selection` until you run `select_frames.py`.

---

## YouTube Bot Detection (cookies.txt)

Chrome 127+ broke yt-dlp's automatic cookie extraction (`--cookies-from-browser` fails with DPAPI error). If you see `Sign in to confirm you're not a bot` errors, fix it once:

1. Install the **"Get cookies.txt LOCALLY"** extension in Chrome/Edge/Firefox
2. Go to **youtube.com** while logged in to your Google account
3. Click the extension icon → **Export** → save as **`cookies.txt`**
4. Place `cookies.txt` in `~/.claude/skills/houdini-wand/` (same folder as `ingest.py`)
5. `ingest.py` detects it automatically — no other changes needed

> `cookies.txt` is in `.gitignore` and will never be committed to GitHub.

---

## Troubleshooting

**`ffmpeg: command not found` after install**
Open a new PowerShell window — PATH updates don't apply to the current session.

**`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'whisper'`**
```powershell
pip install openai-whisper
```

**`CUDA: False` when you have an NVIDIA GPU**
```powershell
pip install torch --force-reinstall --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
```

**Git push fails (authentication)**
```powershell
git config --global credential.helper manager
```
Then re-run the push — Windows Credential Manager will prompt for GitHub login.

**Whisper model download on first run**
The first time Whisper runs it downloads the model (~150 MB for `base`). This is normal — subsequent runs use the cached model.

**Houdini not installed — skill still works**
The houdini-wand skill operates in consultant mode only (no direct Houdini connection). You don't need Houdini installed to ask questions, get VEX code, or ingest tutorials. You only need Houdini to actually run the generated code.

## Ingest Pipeline Reference

The pipeline is two scripts, run in sequence — frame capture is a deliberate,
content-aware step done by Claude Code, not something either script guesses at:

```
Step 1 — collect transcript only, no video/frames:
python ingest.py <url>
python ingest.py <url> --skip-video            article/text-only ingest, no frames ever
python ingest.py <url> --whisper-model small   better accuracy, slower
python ingest.py <url> --whisper-model medium  best accuracy, much slower
python ingest.py <url> --force                 re-collect even if extraction_status: complete (overwrites Structured Notes)

Step 2 — after reading the timestamped transcript, capture the chosen moments:
python select_frames.py <slug> <ts1> <ts2> ...   seconds or mm:ss, e.g. 10 60 4:20 8:05
python select_frames.py <slug> ... --force       re-capture even if frame_status: complete
```

`ingest.py` refuses to overwrite a tutorial `.md` whose frontmatter already has `extraction_status: complete`, to protect hand-written Structured Notes from being wiped by an accidental re-ingest. Pass `--force` only when you intend to discard the existing extraction and will re-run the extraction pass afterward. `select_frames.py` has the same guard on `frame_status: complete`.

Pipeline stages:
1. yt-dlp metadata + chapter list
2. Whisper transcription (or yt-dlp captions fallback), per-sentence timestamps preserved even inside chapters
3. Transcript segmented by chapter
4. Write `tutorials/<slug>.md` (`frame_status: pending-selection`) + update `INDEX.md` + git push — **no video download, no frames yet**
5. Claude Code reads the timestamped transcript and picks 4-8 content-anchored moments (not blind percentages)
6. `select_frames.py <slug> <timestamps>` downloads the low-quality video, extracts exactly those frames to `tutorials/frames/<slug>/`, sets `frame_status: complete` — not committed yet
7. Claude Code vision-reads each captured frame (Houdini network, VEX, parameter editor) and writes the Structured Notes (core technique, steps, nodes/VEX, tags)
8. Auto cross-linking with existing tutorials (2+ shared tags)
9. Update `INDEX.md`, commit `.md` + `INDEX.md` together, git push
